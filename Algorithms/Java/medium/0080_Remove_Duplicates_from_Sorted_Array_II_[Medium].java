/**
 * 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
 *
 *
 * Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
 *
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 *
 * Clarification:
 *
 * Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
 *
 * Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.
 *
 * Internally you can think of this:
 *
 * // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
 * int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
 *
 * // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
 * // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
 * for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
 *     print(nums[i]);
 * }
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
 * Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
 * Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
 * Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
 * Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1. 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * 2. -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 3. nums is sorted in ascending order.
