/**
 * 1254. Number of Closed Islands
 *
 * Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.
 *
 * Return the number of closed islands.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
 *                [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 *                [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
 *                [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
 *                [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
 *                [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 *                [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
