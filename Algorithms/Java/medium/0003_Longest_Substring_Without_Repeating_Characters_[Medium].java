/**
 * 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 *
 *
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest
 * substring
 *  without repeating characters.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1. 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 2. s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
