/**
 * 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 *
 *
 * Given a string s that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.
 *
 * In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.
 *
 * Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
 *
 * Note:
 * Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "ABAB", k = 2
 *
 * Output:
 * 4
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 *
 * Output:
 * 4
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
