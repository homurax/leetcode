/**
 * 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted
 *
 *
 * You are given an integer array arr of length n that represents a permutation of the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
 *
 * We split arr into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.
 *
 * Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
 * For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
 * However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1. n == arr.length
 * 2. 1 <= n <= 10
 * 3. 0 <= arr[i] < n
 * 4. All the elements of arr are unique.
