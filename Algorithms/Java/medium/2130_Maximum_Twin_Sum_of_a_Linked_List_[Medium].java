/**
 * 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List
 *
 *
 * In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.
 *
 * For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
 * The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
 *
 * Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
 * There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
 * Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
 * - Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
 * - Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
 * Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,100000]
 * Output: 100001
 * Explanation:
 * There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1. The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 10^5].
 * 2. 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
