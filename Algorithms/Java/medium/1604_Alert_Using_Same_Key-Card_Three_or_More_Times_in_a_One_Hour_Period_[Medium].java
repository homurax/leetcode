/**
 * 1604. Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period
 *
 *
 * LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.
 *
 * You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.
 *
 * Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".
 *
 * Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.
 *
 * Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: keyName = ["daniel","daniel","daniel","luis","luis","luis","luis"], keyTime = ["10:00","10:40","11:00","09:00","11:00","13:00","15:00"]
 * Output: ["daniel"]
 * Explanation: "daniel" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("10:00","10:40", "11:00").
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: keyName = ["alice","alice","alice","bob","bob","bob","bob"], keyTime = ["12:01","12:00","18:00","21:00","21:20","21:30","23:00"]
 * Output: ["bob"]
 * Explanation: "bob" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("21:00","21:20", "21:30").
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= keyName.length, keyTime.length <= 10^5
 * keyName.length == keyTime.length
 * keyTime[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
 * [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] is unique.
 * 1 <= keyName[i].length <= 10
 * keyName[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
