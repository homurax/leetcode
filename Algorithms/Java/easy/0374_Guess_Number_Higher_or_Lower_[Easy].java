/**
 * 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
 *
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
 *
 * You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
 *
 * -1 : My number is lower
 *  1 : My number is higher
 *  0 : Congrats! You got it!
 * Example :
 *
 * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 * Output: 6
