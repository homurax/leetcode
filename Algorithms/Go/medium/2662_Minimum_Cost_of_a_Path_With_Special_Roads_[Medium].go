/*
2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads

You are given an array start where start = [startX, startY] represents your initial position (startX, startY) in a 2D space. You are also given the array target where target = [targetX, targetY] represents your target position (targetX, targetY).

The cost of going from a position (x1, y1) to any other position in the space (x2, y2) is |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.

There are also some special roads. You are given a 2D array specialRoads where specialRoads[i] = [x1i, y1i, x2i, y2i, costi] indicates that the ith special road goes in one direction from (x1i, y1i) to (x2i, y2i) with a cost equal to costi. You can use each special road any number of times.

Return the minimum cost required to go from (startX, startY) to (targetX, targetY).

Example 1:

Input: start = [1,1], target = [4,5], specialRoads = [[1,2,3,3,2],[3,4,4,5,1]]

Output: 5

Explanation:

(1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
(1,2) to (3,3). Use specialRoads[0] with the cost 2.
(3,3) to (3,4) with a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1.
(3,4) to (4,5). Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 1.
So the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: start = [3,2], target = [5,7], specialRoads = [[5,7,3,2,1],[3,2,3,4,4],[3,3,5,5,5],[3,4,5,6,6]]

Output: 7

Explanation:

It is optimal not to use any special edges and go directly from the starting to the ending position with a cost |5 - 3| + |7 - 2| = 7.

Note that the specialRoads[0] is directed from (5,7) to (3,2).

Example 3:

Input: start = [1,1], target = [10,4], specialRoads = [[4,2,1,1,3],[1,2,7,4,4],[10,3,6,1,2],[6,1,1,2,3]]

Output: 8

Explanation:

(1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
(1,2) to (7,4). Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 4.
(7,4) to (10,4) with a cost of |10 - 7| + |4 - 4| = 3.

Constraints:

start.length == target.length == 2
1 <= startX <= targetX <= 10^5
1 <= startY <= targetY <= 10^5
1 <= specialRoads.length <= 200
specialRoads[i].length == 5
startX <= x1i, x2i <= targetX
startY <= y1i, y2i <= targetY
1 <= costi <= 10^5
