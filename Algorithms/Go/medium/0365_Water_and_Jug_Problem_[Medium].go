365. Water and Jug Problem

You are given two jugs with capacities x liters and y liters. You have an infinite water supply. Return whether the total amount of water in both jugs may reach target using the following operations:

Fill either jug completely with water.
Completely empty either jug.
Pour water from one jug into another until the receiving jug is full, or the transferring jug is empty.

Example 1:

Input: x = 3, y = 5, target = 4

Output: true

Explanation:

Follow these steps to reach a total of 4 liters:

Fill the 5-liter jug (0, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, leaving 2 liters (3, 2).
Empty the 3-liter jug (0, 2).
Transfer the 2 liters from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (2, 0).
Fill the 5-liter jug again (2, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full. This leaves 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (3, 4).
Empty the 3-liter jug. Now, you have exactly 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (0, 4).
Reference: The Die Hard example.

Example 2:

Input: x = 2, y = 6, target = 5

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: x = 1, y = 2, target = 3

Output: true

Explanation: Fill both jugs. The total amount of water in both jugs is equal to 3 now.

Constraints:

1 <= x, y, target <= 10^3
